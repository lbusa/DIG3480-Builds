I chose the karting microgame because I had more asset ideas to try for karting than FPS.
This was also helpful in the case my original ideas didn't work for some reason.
I was also a little more familiar with the karting game since I hadn't explored much of the FPS game but I had gone around the karting track many times.

While I was working I had an issue come up. 
I had downloaded an asset pack and picked out a few models to import, but when I tried to place them in the scene window, they wouldn't appear.
I looked back at the files and realized there was no dropdown for "models" and I had downloaded game objects from "prefabs."
I downloaded a different pack which did have a dropdown menu for models and worked without issue.

I found my assets from the Unity Store, titled CubexCube - Free Medieval Cemetery Pack.
I imported it by first pressing the "Add to My Assets" and "Open in Unity" buttons.
When I went to Unity, I downloaded the pack from the "package manager" window. 
When that finished I pressed the "import" button and a window with all of the assets appeared.
I checked off the few assets that I wanted and clicked "import."
They appeared in the "projects" window and I dragged each one into the "scene" window to place it.
